## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks. This project is a Python implementation of NEAT.  It was forked from MattKallada's excellent project, and updated to work with current libraries.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please visit: [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) in Stanley's website.

## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (XOR, single pole balancing, or double pole balancing) and then try creating your own experiment.
