## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks. This project is a Python implementation of NEAT.  It was forked from the excellent project by @MattKallada, and is in the process of being updated to provide speedups and to work with current libraries.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) in Stanley's website.


## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (XOR, single pole balancing, or double pole balancing) and then try creating your own experiment.

The documentation, which is still a work in progress, is available on [Read The Docs](http://neat-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
