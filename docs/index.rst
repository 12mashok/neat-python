Welcome to NEAT-Python's documentation!
=======================================

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural
networks. NEAT-Python is a pure Python implementation of NEAT, with no dependencies other than the Python standard library.

Support for HyperNEAT and other extensions to NEAT is planned once the fundamental NEAT implementation is
more complete and stable.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see `Selected Publications
<http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications>`_ on Stanley's website, or his recent `AMA on Reddit
